# isec355 - An extension for MDAnalysis package.
Named from Northeastern University.

## Aims
This python package is used for lipid bilayer MD simulation results. Properties could be calculated by this work:

* Area per lipid 
* bilayer thickness
* area compressibility modulus
* diffusion coefficients
* order parameters
* terminal methyl group distributions
* bending modulus (on going)
* water-lipid interfaces analysis (on going)
* Voronoi diagrams (on going)

## Usage
Download and import isec355 as a package.

## Note
This project is under construction, updating slowly as related work in progress.
